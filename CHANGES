Release 0.2.0 (Sep 24, 2014)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Implemented the HTML representation protocol of MarkupSafe. We can render
  items in Jinja 2 templates directly now.
- Refactored the ``is_active`` implementation. We can use the extracted APIs
  such as ``is_internal`` now.

Thanks for `Axel Haustant <https://github.com/noirbizarre>`_ who contributed
those features:

- Added support to create nested items.
- Added support to access current item from navigation bar.
